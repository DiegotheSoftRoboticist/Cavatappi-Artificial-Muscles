Data collection outline:
 
-Cavatappi Efficiency: Raw data used to plot energy in and out curves to calculate the contractile 
efficiency of cavatappi.
-Cavatppi New Configuration: Raw data used to plot the contractile actuation response of cavatappi as a 
function of time and input pressure. 
-LifeTime: 10000 cycles actuation (Raw data)
-Nylon Monofilament thermal properties: Data from Smart Materials and Structures used to plot the axial
 and radial thermal expansion of drawn nylon. (Used with permission)
-Power: Raw data of velocity during contraction of cavatappi tests used to calculate speficic power.
-Precursor and drawn precursor tubes axial and radial expansions. Raw data used to measure radial and 
axial expansion of precursor drawn/undrawn tubes.
-PublishedDATA.xlsx: A excel file that contains all the published data in Science Robotics.

Methodology:

To measure axial and radial strain, as well as torsional and linear displacement in actuation tests, we used a 
Polytec OFV-5000 Vibrometer controller with the OFV 534 optics head. To apply and measure pressure in these tests, 
we used a RG1262-1500 pressure regulator along with QB1T closed loop servo system and a DS series pressure 
transducer. The voltage outputs of these systems are linearly related to a change of position of the object on which
it focuses (vibrometer) and change in pressure (pressure transducer) (Fig. S2). This voltage was recorded by a 
National Instruments PXI-6361 multifunction data acquisition card and subsequently analyzed to develop the data.
